# rest-fundamentals
REST is an overloaded, and thus misunderstood term in architectural circles these days. This tutorial attempts to clear up some of the misunderstandings about REST as well as provide a more practical approach for designing RESTful solutions - both clients and services. Additionally, the course looks at REST from the perspective of the cloud and describes how REST is well-suited to meet the demands that the cloud brings to bear on a modern architecture.
